## RADar RESEARCH & INNOVATION PROJECTS 

 

The RADar research & innovation team is composed of a multidisciplinary team of experts in data science, AI technology, healthcare & technology, collaborating closely to pursue impactful research outcomes. 

 

### RESEARCH PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

RADar research projects aim to leverage the power of data to transform the healthcare industry and improve patient care. Spearheads are artificial intelligence (A.I.), data science, mobile health (remote mHealth care), nutrition&health and business intelligence & planning. 

 

### 1. ADAM part lung cancer 

Advanced Data-Aided Medicine Part Lung Cancer 

- Objective Developing and validating an AI model that supports physicians in their decision process for treating lung cancer patients. This AI model needs to predict the probability/evolution of the outcomes, based on clinical data and simulated lung cancer treatment plans. The outcome probabilities can be evaluated through different treatment plans to identify the optimal treatment plan for a patient. 

- Methodology Automatic unlocking, collection & transformation of lung cancer datapoints to OMOP common data model so that data is readily available for further research & analysis. Training and validating supervised machine learning models with a limited feature set as input to predict lung cancer patient outcomes. Constructing a digital patient by training an AI model fed with all data available in OMOP common data model. Validating a digital patient & optimal feature selection to enhance AI model performance via unsupervised learning techniques 

- Impact Careful analysis of the collected data using artificial intelligence tools might support physicians & lung cancer patients in their treatment decision process. 

- Partners UGent IDLab 

- RADar project research lead: Louise Berteloot 

- Principle investigator: Dr. Ingel Demedts 

- Timeline 2021-2024 

- Funding Vlaio O&O 

- Ethics NCT05783024 Advanced Data-Aided Medicine Part Lung Cancer - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov 

- Status: looking for validation cohorts in hospitals 

 

### 2. ADAM part coronary artery disease 

Advanced Data-Aided Medicine Part Coronary Artery Disease 

- Objective: 

Developing and validating an AI-driven clinical decision support tool for the optimization of treatment plans for patients with coronary artery disease. The AI-model should predict clinically relevant outcomes, such as mortality, rehospitalizations and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), using multiple data sources, such as hospital records, ECG recordings, laboratory values… 

- Methodology: 

Transformation of electronic health record data to the OMOP Common Data Model, which is built on a foundation of standardized vocabularies and a simple patient-centric data model. This is done by in-house development of open-source ETL-tools, shared in the OHDSI-community. Data is extracted using our cohort extraction tool with  custom clinical phenotypes. 

Augmenting state-of-art deep learning models for ECG classification with structured data extracted from our OMOP dataset. Limitations in dataset size are overcome by first optimizing the model architecture on related tasks with larger datasets, followed by pre-training the model on more generic tasks.  

- Impact: 

This clinical decision support might improve standardization of treatment plans across similar patients and guide decisions for clinically more complex cases.  

- Partners: UGent IDLab 

- RADar project research lead: Ir. Stijn Dupulthys, MD

### 3. ProCaTS 

Prostate Cancer Support Tool 

- Objective ProCaTS aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a data/A.I.-driven decision support tool for personalized and optimal treatment choice in clinical practice in prostate cancer. The project envisions developing an explainable A.I. and combining it with a dashboard tailored to clinicians' needs. This will increase the adoption of artificial intelligence (A.I.) in clinical practice 

- Methodology Unlocking and linking data from underlying silos in an automated way, with 90% accuracy and completeness and based on the OMOP CDM. Training explainable ML models, which can be used to predict patient outcomes. Develop a decision support tool, which objectively informs physicians.  

- Impact Acceptance of physicians to use the tool, measured by tracking their actions in the software and aiming for >50% of patients to be consulted this way. Partners anticipate further development of the solution and a pathway to be planned to have the solution medically approved so that it can be rolled out to other hospitals  

- Partners: Siemens Healthineers, ML6 

- RADar project research lead: dr. Nathalie Mertens 

- Principle investigator: Dr. Wim Van Haute 

- Timeline 2022-2023 

- Funding projectbudget 2021 Flanders.healthTech Vlaio, MEDVIA  

- Status: research ongoing 



### 4. BreaCS 

Breast Cancer Support 

- Objective The BreaCS project aims to develop a quasi-real-time A.I. based clinical decision support system (CDSS) for breast cancer treatment selection. The CDSS will combine radiology, pathology and clinical data into a unique smart A.I. solution. 

- Methodology This project aims to explore the potential of a clinical decision support system, develop solutions to practical problems of using a CDSS, and evaluate the performance multicentric. 3 AI models will be developed to predict at pre-operative timing 1 the pathological tumor size, 2 the need to remove axillary glands and 3 chemotherapy treatment effects 

- Impact In Belgium, 1 in 7 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during lifetime. This project will evaluate an A.I. based clinical decision support system (CDSS) multicentric. If further clinical validation and certification steps are finalized, this could mean that medical interventions could be avoided, treatments would be more effective & personalized.  

- Partners: AZ Groeninge, GZA, Endare 

- RADar project research lead: Pieter-Jan Lammertyn 

- Principle investigator: Dr. Barbara Bussels 

- Timeline 2023-2024 

- Funding projectbudget 2022 Flanders.healthTech Vlaio, MEDVIA  

- Status: data collection & research started 

 

### 5. PNH screening tool 

- Objective Develop a PNH screening tool on the AZ Delta Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to enhance identification of patients with high PNH risk factors and to reduce the delay in PNH diagnosis. 

- Methodology Developing an algorithm to identify a high-risk cohort of potential PNH patients who need treatment from all registered patients, with maximum ability to find relevant cases. Secondly, this high-risk cohort will be manually reviewed by clinicians for final screening.  

- Impact: Enhancing early detection of PNH diagnosis since Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a life-threathening hematological disorder. Prevalence is estimated between 1-5 per million people, often manifested by cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological or haematological symptoms. Referral is therefore typically to several specialists, resulting in PNH underdiagnosis. 

- RADar project research lead: ir Kim Denturck 

- Priniciple investigator: Dr. Dries Deeren 

- Timeline 2021-2023 

- Funding Alexion, Pharma Belgium provides financial support  

- Status finalizing research report & preparing research publication. Considering next steps: finetuning the algorithm and converting the system to a prospective PNH monitor. Additionally, a probability estimator ranking patients in decreasing order of potential PNH risk can be developed.

## RADar UPCOMING EVENT CALENDAR 

 

### RADar summer school 2023 

The RADar summer school 2023 offers participants the opportunity to tackle various practical implementation steps and challenges to facilitate final secondary use of data in their own organization.  

RADar offers its own expertise and tools that it has experienced in setting up its own automated data pipeline with the aim of gaining insights from data-driven innovation and research projects.   

 

The goal of the RADar summer school 2023 for participants is to execute practical like: 

- fetch data from multiple (hospital) databases 

- data pseudonimization 

- send data securely to a cloud environment 

- set up an ETL implementation 

- introduction to various OHDSI tools and RADar tools Riab®, KEUN®  

- creating mapping tables and storing them in OMOP CDM tables 

- perform analyses and train a logistic model 

 

The context of the exercises are starting from clinically relevant research questions and the exercises will be run through so that data can be extracted from source systems, prepared, harmonized, stored in OMOP CDM tables to be processed afterwards generating valuable insights. 

Participants will present their exercises and knowledge trajectory in front of the group on the 5th and last day of the summer school course to obtain a summer school certificate.
