### 2. ADAM part coronary artery disease 

Advanced Data-Aided Medicine Part Coronary Artery Disease 

- **Objective:** Developing and validating an AI-driven clinical decision support tool for the optimization of treatment plans for patients with coronary artery disease. The AI-model should predict clinically relevant outcomes, such as mortality, rehospitalizations and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), using multiple data sources, such as hospital records, ECG recordings, laboratory values… 

- **Methodology:** Transformation of electronic health record data to the OMOP Common Data Model, which is built on a foundation of standardized vocabularies and a simple patient-centric data model. This is done by in-house development of open-source ETL-tools, shared in the OHDSI-community. Data is extracted using our cohort extraction tool with  custom clinical phenotypes. 

Augmenting state-of-art deep learning models for ECG classification with structured data extracted from our OMOP dataset. Limitations in dataset size are overcome by first optimizing the model architecture on related tasks with larger datasets, followed by pre-training the model on more generic tasks.  

- **Impact:** This clinical decision support might improve standardization of treatment plans across similar patients and guide decisions for clinically more complex cases.

### 3. ProCaTS 

Prostate Cancer Support Tool 

- **Objective:** ProCaTS aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a data/A.I.-driven decision support tool for personalized and optimal treatment choice in clinical practice in prostate cancer. The project envisions developing an explainable A.I. and combining it with a dashboard tailored to clinicians' needs. This will increase the adoption of artificial intelligence (A.I.) in clinical practice 

- **Methodology:** Unlocking and linking data from underlying silos in an automated way, with 90% accuracy and completeness and based on the OMOP CDM. Training explainable ML models, which can be used to predict patient outcomes. Develop a decision support tool, which objectively informs physicians.  

- **Impact:** Acceptance of physicians to use the tool, measured by tracking their actions in the software and aiming for >50% of patients to be consulted this way. Partners anticipate further development of the solution and a pathway to be planned to have the solution medically approved so that it can be rolled out to other hospitals  

- **Partners:** Siemens Healthineers, ML6 

- **RADar project research lead:** dr. Nathalie Mertens 

- **Principle investigator:** Dr. Wim Van Haute 

- **Timeline:** 2022-2023

### 4. BreaCS 

Breast Cancer Support 

- **Objective:** The BreaCS project aims to develop a quasi-real-time A.I. based clinical decision support system (CDSS) for breast cancer treatment selection. The CDSS will combine radiology, pathology and clinical data into a unique smart A.I. solution. 

- **Methodology:** This project aims to explore the potential of a clinical decision support system, develop solutions to practical problems of using a CDSS, and evaluate the performance multicentric. 3 AI models will be developed to predict at pre-operative timing 1 the pathological tumor size, 2 the need to remove axillary glands and 3 chemotherapy treatment effects 

- **Impact:** In Belgium, 1 in 7 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during lifetime. This project will evaluate an A.I. based clinical decision support system (CDSS) multicentric. If further clinical validation and certification steps are finalized, this could mean that medical interventions could be avoided, treatments would be more effective & personalized.

### 5. PNH screening tool 

- **Objective:** Develop a PNH screening tool on the AZ Delta Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to enhance identification of patients with high PNH risk factors and to reduce the delay in PNH diagnosis. 

- **Methodology:** Developing an algorithm to identify a high-risk cohort of potential PNH patients who need treatment from all registered patients, with maximum ability to find relevant cases. Secondly, this high-risk cohort will be manually reviewed by clinicians for final screening.  

- **Impact:** Enhancing early detection of PNH diagnosis since Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a life-threathening hematological disorder. Prevalence is estimated between 1-5 per million people, often manifested by cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological or haematological symptoms. Referral is therefore typically to several specialists, resulting in PNH underdiagnosis.

- **Priniciple investigator:** Dr. Dries Deeren 

- **Timeline:** 2021-2023 

- **Funding:** Alexion, Pharma Belgium provides financial support  

- **Status:** finalizing research report & preparing research publication. Considering next steps: finetuning the algorithm and converting the system to a prospective PNH monitor. Additionally, a probability estimator ranking patients in decreasing order of potential PNH risk can be developed.  


### 6. AI-driven EGFR Detection in H&E histopathology slides of NSCLC
- **Objective:** Developing an AI model to detect Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides.
  
- **Methodology:** Unsupervised tumor segmentation, feature extraction with pretrained ResNet-50 and attention-based multiple instance learning for EGFR mutation classification.
  
- **Impact:** For therapeutic decision making in NSCLC, molecular profiling is crucial, as a number of gene alterations are eligible for targeted therapy. However, the molecular testing is expensive, time consuming and requires enough tumor tissue for testing. AI-based detection of gene alterations e.g. pathogenic/likely pathogenic EGFR mutations in H&E stained WSIs of NSCLCs could make a fast estimation of the odds of an actionable target being present and could ideally even predict the type of mutation (L858R, exon19 deletion or other).
  
- **RADar project research lead:** Louise Berteloot
  
- **Principle investigator:** Dr. Franceska Dedeurwaerdere
  
- **Timeline:** 2023-2024
  
- **Funding:** AstraZeneca
  
- **Status:** ongoing research
  
### 7. PhonAID

Phoniatrics Artificial Intelligence Detection tool

- **Objective:** Through PhonAID, our objective is to transfer specialized knowledge from secondary care to primary care, enabling early detection of voice disorders. Achieving this goal involves implementing an application equipped with an AI model.
  
- **Methodology:** Combining audio recordings of speech tasks with clinical data and questionnaires as input to an AI model to classify categories of voice disorders. A population of individuals with a healthy voice will constitute a separate category to confirm the absence of a voice disorder. The AI model will be implemented in a user-friendly application for patients and general practitioners to use. The patients will enter clinical data, answer questionnaires and perform several speech tasks on which the AI model will make a prediction.
  
- **Impact:** The voice serves as a crucial means of communication, and its impairment can lead to social challenges and hinder professional performance. Additionally, a voice disorder may indicate an underlying lung or neck tumor. Early detection is strongly advised to preserve quality of life and enhance patient outcomes.
